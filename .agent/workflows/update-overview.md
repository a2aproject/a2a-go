description: Update project overview
---

Your task is to analyze the codebase and create a high-quality developer guide. The summary should enable another AI or a new developer to quickly understand the project.

Please include:
1.  **Project Overview**: What is this project? Primary problem it solves.
2.  **Architecture & Patterns**: Brief explanation of the design.
3.  **Directory Map**: An annotated tree or list of the most important top-level directories and their roles.
4.  **Core Concepts**: Any pervasive domain terms or specific abstractions.

**Constraint**: Keep it concise. Focus on *intent* and *structure* rather than implementation details.

Save your summaries in @./docs/ai/OVERVIEW.md overwriting the existing content.
