// Package taskexec provides a concurrent agent invocation manager.
// The manager enforces concurrency control on task level and guarantees that at any given moment
// there's only one goroutine which is mutating the state of an [a2a.Task].
//
// For every [Execution] the [Manager] start two goroutines in an [errgroup.Group]:
//   - One calls [Executor] and starts producing events writing them to an [eventqueue.Queue].
//   - The second one reads events in a loop and passes them through [Processor] responsible for deciding when to stop.
//
// For cancelations the handling is different depending on whether there exists a concurrent execution:
//   - When a concurrent execution exists, only one goroutine is started which calls [Canceler]. It writes an event to the same queue
//     the execution is using and expects the concurrently-running event consumer to handle it.
//   - When there's no concurrent execution, the mechanism is the same as for the execution: one goroutine which calls cancel and the second one
//     which processes events.
//
// Event consumer continues to run waiting for a terminal event to be produced, even if execution goroutine finished.
//
